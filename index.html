            <h1>This is Caleb's biography</h1>
            <p>My name is Caleb Elie, I'm a Web developer who started his journey back in november 2023, however I was fortunate enough to cross path with a man of God who decided to change my life cos deep down I had the burning desire to embark on this journey but I didn't have guidance but thankfully God has made it happen and I'm willing to make him proud, to pave the way for those kids out there who are talented but have no sponsor,my goal is to be able to build a tech company where we will hire tech advocate of different domain so that together, we will build a solid platform where there is no scarcity for job and at the same time we will make sure to teach young people who need tutelage at an affordable price.</p>
